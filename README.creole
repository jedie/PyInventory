= PyInventory

Web based management to catalog things including state and location etc. using Python/Django.

The project is in an early stage of development. Some things are already implemented and usable. But there is still a lot to do.

Pull requests welcome!

== about

The focus of this project is on the management of retro computing hardware.

Plan:

* Web-based
* Multiuser ready
* Chaotic warehousing
** Grouped "Storage": Graphics card is in computer XY
* Data structure kept as general as possible
* You should be able to add the following to the items:
** Storage location
** State
** Pictures and Files
** URLs
** receiving and delivering (when, from whom, at what price, etc.)
** Information: Publicly visible yes/no
* A public list of existing items (think about it, you can set in your profile if you want to)
* administration a wish & exchange list

any many more... ;)


== Project structure

There are two main directories:

|= directory |= description
| **[[https://github.com/jedie/PyInventory/tree/master/src|/src/]]**               | The main PyInventory source code
| **[[https://github.com/jedie/PyInventory/tree/master/deployment|/deployment/]]** | deploy PyInventory for production use case

== install

There exists these kind of installation/usage:

* local development installation using poetry
* production use with docker-compose on a root server
* Install as [[https://yunohost.org|YunoHost]] App via [[https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/pyinventory_ynh|pyinventory_ynh]]

This README contains only the information about local development installation.

Read [[https://github.com/jedie/PyInventory/tree/master/deployment#readme|/deployment/README]] for instruction to install PyInventory on a root server.


=== local development installation

e.g.:
{{{
# Clone project (Use your fork SSH url!):
~$ git clone https://github.com/jedie/PyInventory.git
~$ cd PyInventory
~/PyInventory$ ./devshell.py
}}}


Helpful for writing and debugging unittests is to run a local test server.
e.g.:
{{{
~/PyInventory$ ./devshell.py run_testserver
}}}
The web page is available via: {{{http://127.0.0.1:8000/}}}

You can also pass a other port number or {{{ipaddr:port}}} combination. See: {{{./devshell.py run_testserver --help}}}

Call manage commands from test project, e.g.:
{{{
~/PyInventory$ ./devshell.py manage --help
}}}


=== local docker dev run

You can run the deployment docker containers with current source code with:
{{{
~/PyInventory$ make run-docker-dev-server
}}}
Just hit Cntl-C to stop the containers

The web page is available via: {{{https://localhost/}}}

== Multi user support

PyInventory supports multiple users. The idea:

* Every normal user sees only his own created database entries
* All users used the Django admin

Note: All created Tags are shared for all existing users!


So setup a normal user:

* Set "Staff status"
* Unset "Superuser status"
* Add user to "normal_user" group
* Don't add any additional permissions

e.g.:

{{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedie/jedie.github.io/master/screenshots/PyInventory/PyInventory normal user example.png|normal user example}}


== Backwards-incompatible changes

=== v0.7.0

Docker-Compose usage: The MEDIA files was not stored on a docker volumes.

You should backup rhe media files **before** update the containers!

e.g.:
{{{
~/PyInventory/deployment$ make shell_inventory
root@inventory:/django# cp -Rfv /media/ /django_volumes/media/
}}}
The files are stored locally here:
{{{
~/PyInventory/deployment$ ls -la volumes/django/media/
}}}
Now, update the containers and copy the files back.


=== v0.5.0

Git branches "master" and "deployment" was merged into one.
Files are separated into: "/src/" and "/development/"
